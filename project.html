Project #1
Currently, I am working on a project that would help banks figure out the right clients to give credit card to. Also, I will help banks set the perfect credit card balance limit to each client inorder to avoid clients from getting default. To help illustrating this to the bank, I used dataset from Kaggle.com website. Using this dataset, I showed the relationship between default payment and some clients characteristics such as age, education, marriage, etc.. In the link below, you will see the progress of my project so far.
