<center><h1> Project </h1> </center>

<center>Currently, I am working on a project that would help banks figure out the right clients to give credit card to. </center>
<center>Also, I will help banks set the perfect credit card balance limit to each client inorder to avoid clients from </center>
<center>getting default. To help illustrating this to the bank, I used dataset from Kaggle.com website. Using this dataset,</center>
<center>I showed the relationship between default payment and some clients characteristics such as age, education, marriage,</center>
<center>etc.. In the link below, you will see the progress of my project so far.

  <center><h1> Stat 385 </h1></center>
  
<center>In my Stat 385 course, I did learn how to create a French roulette game using R script and R markdown. First, I imported </center>
<center>the data to rmarkdown using data frame "Wheel". Once I imported the data, I was able to create a function that would </center>
<center>make me generate a random number. I also made a function that check if the number I picked would be equal to the random </center>
<center>number or not. If the number I picked is equal to the random number, it would print "True". Otherwise, it will print "false".</center>
