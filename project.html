<h1> Project </h1> 

Currently, I am working on a project that would help banks figure out the right clients to give credit card to. 
Also, I will help banks set the perfect credit card balance limit to each client inorder to avoid clients from 
getting default. To help illustrating this to the bank, I used dataset from Kaggle.com website. Using this dataset,
I showed the relationship between default payment and some clients characteristics such as age, education, marriage,
etc.. In the link below, you will see the progress of my project so far.

<h1> Stat 385 </h1>
In my Stat 385 course, I did learn how to create a French roulette game using R script and R markdown. First, I imported 
the data to rmarkdown using data frame "Wheel". Once I imported the data, I was able to create a function that would 
make me generate a random number. I also made a function that check if the number I picked would be equal to the random 
number or not. If the number I picked is equal to the random number, it would print "True". Otherwise, it will print "false".
